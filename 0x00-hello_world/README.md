# C ðŸ“ƒ 0x00-hello_world
## About this project:
### In this project I will learn and practiced;

- Why C programming is awesome
- Who invented C
- Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
- What happens when you type gcc main.c
- What is an entry point
- What is main
- How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
- How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
- How to compile using gcc
-  What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
- What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
- How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
- How does the main function influence the return value of the program
## Tasks file description;
* 0-preprocessor: Bash script that runs a C file saved in the variable $CFILE through the preprocessor and saves the result in the file c.

* 1-compiler: Bash script that compiles a C file saved in the variable $CFILE that does not link; saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a .o extension.

* Example: If the C file is main.c, the output is main.o.
* 2-assembler: Bash script that generates the assembly code of a C code saved in the variable $CFILE; saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a .s extension.

* Example: If the C file is main.c, the result is main.s.
* 3-name: Bash Script that compiles a C file saved in the variable $CFILE and creates an executable cisfun.

* 4-puts.c: C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building   a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line, using the function puts.

* 5-printf.c: C program that prints exactly with proper grammer, but   the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line, using the function printf.

* 6-size.c: C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

* 100-intel: Script that generates the assembly code in Intel syntax of a C file saved in the variable $CFILE; saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a .s extension.

* Example: If the C file is main.c, the output is main.s.
* 101-quote.c: C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is   useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error, without using any functions listed in the NAME sesction of the man(3) printf or man(3) puts.
